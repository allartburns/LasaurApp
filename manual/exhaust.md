Ideas for Building an Exhaust system
=====================================

- box with vertically stacked filters (allowing for varialbe height), exhaust goes in at the top, gets filter through HEPA, active carbon, and blown out at the bottom
- radial blower at the bottom (800m3/h, 14m3/min, 470cfm)
- possibly a prefilter that washes easily
- inside padded with foam insulation for noise reduction
- cross section for "20x20 inch filter"
- pressure sensor for detecting full filter
