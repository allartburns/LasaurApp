1. Prepare parts for this subsystem (See [BOM](bom.md) by subsystem)
2. Start by connecting the two aluminum extrusions with M5x25 screws.
3. Mount low-profile M5x16 belt attachment screws to the underside of the horizontal extrusion, 5mm from the front end. 
3. Attach the four angle brackets with M5x08 screws.
4. Attach custom parts to brackets with M5x16 screws, a washer, and a lock nut.
  - The front custom part has distance of 5-7mm from the lower end of the extrusion.
  - The rear custom part has a distance of 19-22mm from the rear end of the extrusion.
5. Attach the four rollers to custom parts.
  - Use M4x25 screws, nut, washer. 
6. Attach one roller to the inside of the front extrusion.
  - Use a M4x15 screw, roller, large washer, M4 T-slot nut.
  - Place at about 9mm from the lower end of the extrusion.
7. Before attaching the inside roller to the rear extrusion place cart on y-bar and make further adjustments. 
  - make sure all parts are perpendicular in all directions
  - all rollers grab the y-bar nicely, with good alignment.
  - the extrusions are perfectly vertical and horizontal, respectively
8. Attach  rear roller, double-check alignment again.
9. At this point the cart should run smoothly on the bar while being constraint in all other ways. Please note that once the belt and motor is attached the motor will introduce some friction from self-induction that can easily mis-interpreted as mis-alignment.
