### Steps

1. Prepare parts for this subsystem (See [BOM](bom.md) by subsystem)
2. Start with the base frame and lower columns.
  - Avoid any gaps, overhanging edges, and non-aligned angle brackets.
  - Take note of thick (4040) and thin (2040) columns and when to use single or double angle brackets.
  - Take note when to use black or regular extrusions/brackets.
  - All angle brackets use M5x10 socket cap screws. Planar brackets use M5x08 screws.
  - The base rectangle (1700x1170mm) is built from  extrusions of length: 1130mm, 1620mm, 860mm, 790mm, 750mm and 190mm.
  - The first level of columns is of height 120mm.
3. Adapt and insert lower separation panels.
  - The two small lower panels need to have their outer corners cut out. The required cutout is roughly 5x6mm. See images for details.
  - Holes for cables can be drilled now or later.
4. Insert entry panel on the side.
  - In case you plan on cutting this with the Lasersaur it can also be installed later by removing the rear corner column and sliding it in from the back.
5. Install frame-table.
6. Install frame-gantry
7. Continue with upper columns.
  - Height is 100mm.
8. Adapt and insert upper separation panels.
  - The top left large panel needs to have the laser outlet hole drilled. With a M16 drill bit create a portal at 80mm from the left and 77mm from the top.
  - The small upper panels need to have their outer corners cut out as well. 
9. Finalize upper and rear frame.
10. Secure panels with clamp rubber. The following lengths of clamp rubber are required: 4x 790mm, 4x 160mm, 4x 590mm (if you also want to apply this rubber on the verticals more is needed)


###Checklist

- All separation windows inserted.
- Laser portal drilled.
