### Steps

1. Prepare parts for this subsystem (See [BOM](bom.md) by subsystem)
2. Attach long inner extrusion to short outer extrusions.
  - Use black angle brackets.
  - Rear offset is 194mm.
  - Spacing between slats, rear to front, is 180mm, 180mm, 170mm.
  - Front offset is 54mm.
3. Attach columns.
  - 4040, 120mm, black in the back, angles attach to the rear slot
  - 2040, 120mm, black in the front
3. Later, when attaching table to frame make sure the height is equal on all attachment points. Once the head is mounted, double-check the height within the entire range of motion.
4. When adjusting the height, account for the thickness of the table surface you will be using (e.g: honeycomb, eggcrate, drywall angles). See [accessories](accessories#surface.md) for possible options.
