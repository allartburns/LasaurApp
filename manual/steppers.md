Note: We have been switching stepper motors quite a bit over the version number. Make sure to double-check the part numbers accordingly.


Nanotec Steppers
------------------------------------

### x-drive

* [ST4118M1206-A](http://en.nanotec.com/steppermotor_st4118.html), [data sheet](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9430160/lasersaur/ST4118M1206.pdf)
* Nema 17 (mounts with M3 screws, square with 31mm, shaft dia: 5mm dia)
* holding torque 0.4 N-m (56 oz-in)
* weight 240g (0.5 lbs)
* shaft length 24mm
* current (bipolar series) 0.85A
* Vmax = 32 * sqrt(11.6) = 109V
* Amax = 0.67 * 0.85 = 0.57A (required power supply)


### y-drive

* [ST5918M3008-B](http://en.nanotec.com/steppermotor_st5918.html), [data sheet](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9430160/lasersaur/ST5918M3008.pdf)
* Nema 23  (mounts with M5 screws, square with 47.2mm, shaft dia: 6.35mm dia)
* holding torque 1.1 N-m (156 oz-in)
* weight 650g (01.43 lbs)
* shaft length 90.1mm (tip front to tip rear shaft)
* current (bipolar, series) 2.1A
* Vmax = 32 * sqrt(4.4) = 67V
* Amax = 0.67 * 2.1 = 1.4A (required power supply)

Other Info
---------

* 1 N-m is about 141.6 oz-in
* 1 N-m is about 10 kg-cm
* [Stepper Sizing Tool](http://www.orientalmotor.com/support/motor-sizing.html)
* on average dynamic torque is approximately 70% of holding torque
* Nema 17, ~42mm square, 30mm square mounts, M3
* Nema 23, ~56.4mm square, 47.2mm square mounts,  M5
