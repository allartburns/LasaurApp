1. Prepare parts for this subsystem (See [BOM](bom.md) by subsystem)
2. Start by assembling the motor and pulley mounts.
3. Attach mounts to the frame loosely, mount drive shafts and idlers, then tighten.
  - Pulley mounts are offset inwards by 22mm.   
  - Align so that idlers are 1mm from the gantry-frame.
  - Center stepper motor as to evenly distribute overlap of the drive shaft couplings.
4. Assemble idlers: screw M5x25, washer, bearing, washer, bearing, 2x washers, slide washer, 2x large washers
5. Attach belts.
  - Start with front idlers about 20mm away from front aluminum extrusion then adjust belt tension by sliding idlers forward.
  - belts are attached to cart [with four zip ties](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stfnix/7014273923).
  - The belt attachment screws are extra low socket cap M5x16s.
  - Tension by pulling at the base of the idler screw with the shaft of a thin screw drive. Use about the force you can easily assert with your wrist only.
  - IMPORTANT: before using the Lasersaur make sure to fine tune the BELT TENSION by following the steps on the [belt tension adjustments](http://labs.nortd.com/lasersaur/manual/timing_belts) page.
7. Differential alignment.
  - Adjust by leaving one shaft coupling open, push y-cart all the way back, then tighten.
8. Cable carrier attachment brackets have M4 holes which need to be widened with an M5 drill bit and mounted with M5x06 screws.
9. Limit switches.
  - Use M2.5x12 screws to attach limit switches to aluminum mounts.
  - Mount the limit switch assembly similar to the pulley assemblies.
