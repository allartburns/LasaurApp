1. Prepare parts for this subsystem (See [BOM](bom.md) by subsystem)
2. [Wiring and Tubing](wiring.md)
3. Use rubber tape between the laser tube and the custom aluminum mounts.
4. Heat the water hose with the heat gun before attaching to glass inlet/outlet.
5. Attach water hose to laser tube with zip ties to prevent stress on inlet/outlet ducts. 
6. Take special care not to slip when tightening screws around the glass tube.
7. [Optics Setup](optics_setup.md)
8. Attach all three mirror mounts to T-slots with metric (black) screw supplied with the mount.
9. Assemble head optics. Nozzle and lens tube may need grease/oil and some turning on/off to smoothly mate.
10. Run air assist tubing from entry panel to e-valve to air assist nozzle.
