### Steps

1. Prepare parts for this subsystem (See [BOM](bom.md) by subsystem)
2. All the panels are pre-cut and partially pre-drilled. Add additional mount holes according to CAD model or drill pattern (effectively keeping mount hole distances under 250mm (10")).
4. Mount emergency stop switch. For this drill a 16mm hole in the right side panel. Offset is about 68mm from front and 88mm from top.
