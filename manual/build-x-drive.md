1. Prepare parts for this subsystem (See [BOM](bom.md) by subsystem)
2. Mount limit switches on y-cart.
  - Use M2.5x12 screws to mount switches onto aluminum custom parts.
  - Use M5x12 screws to mount aluminum custom parts.
4. Mount the cable carrier base (angle bracket extrusion) 
  - with two M5x12 sink screws and six washers (form A M5) each. For this drill two holes into the angle bracket extrusion and countersink sufficiently to prevent cable carrier from catching the mount screws.
5. To mount the cable carrier onto the base drill an M3 hole and use a M3x10 screw, nut and two lock washers. Note the cable carrier comes with a small metal clamp piece with the appropriate M3 hole.
6. Attach belts.
  - Attached to cart with four zip ties.
  - With left idler about 20mm away from left end of the extrusion adjust belt tension by sliding idler left.
  - Tension of belts should be without visible slack, firm enough to prevent belt from jumping on pulley, but not too firm to put unnecessary stress on mechanism.
  - Tension by pulling at the base of the idler screw with the shaft of a thin screw drive. Use about the force you can easily assert with your wrist only.
  - IMPORTANT: before using the Lasersaur make sure to fine tune the BELT TENSION by following the steps on the [belt tension adjustments](http://labs.nortd.com/lasersaur/manual/timing_belts) page.
