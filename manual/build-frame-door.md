### Steps

1. Prepare parts for this subsystem (See [BOM](bom.md) by subsystem)
2. Assemble door without rear extrusion.
  - Take note of the orientation of the middle strut. Unlike all other extrusions it lays flat.
3. Mount the door's rear extrusion to frame using the three hinges.
  - Hinges mount with sink screws.
  - Before fully tightening the screws make sure the joints of the hinges clear the extrusion corners as much as possible (push to corner side of the slot) to prevent unnecessary friction.
4. Attach the door to the mounted rear extrusion.
5. Install the gas springs.
  - For each mount point use an M5x20 screw with 5 small and 5 large washers as shown in the image.
  - The gas springs' distance from the back determines their strength.
6. Install the slit cover panels at the rear bottom of the door.
7. Install door switches.
  - Switches can be mounted in this step or later when wiring the machine.
  - Make sure the door switches sense the door reliably without being crushed by a slammed door. The trigger range can be increased by slightly bending the metal lever upwards. A good test is closing the door, putting your ear close to the switch and listening for the trigger noise when lifting the door minutely.


### Checklist
* Door closes without pushing the gas spings all the way in?
* Door hits the end point of the gas springs simultaneously?
* Symmetric gap between left and right frame?
